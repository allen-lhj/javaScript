## The primitives types

- string represents string values like `"Hello world"`.
- number is for numbers like `42`.
- boolean is for the two values `true` and `false`.

Arrays 
To specify type of an array like [1, 2, 3], we can use the syntax `number[]`

any
ts also has a special type, `any`, that we can use whenever we don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
